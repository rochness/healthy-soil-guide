    <p>This Healthy Soil Guide aims to encourage chefs and consumers to reward
    farmers for using sustainable practices. The contributing scientists will be
    the first to tell you that there's more to soil health than this guide, but that
    if you’re only going to think about soil for 5 seconds, this is a decent place
    to start.</p>
    <p>Healthy soil enhances flavor, nutrition, soil's water-holding capacity, and — critically — a farm’s ability to draw down carbon dioxide and mitigate global warming. Chefs and consumers who care about building a sustainable food system need a way to recognize and support farms that are building soil health.
    </p>
    <p>For the sake of simplicity, we have foregrounded a single metric: Soil
    Organic Matter. This highlights the work of farms that are doing the
    hard work of regenerative agriculture: small organic farmers as well as
    larger operations that work to maximize soil health even if they use some
    chemical fertilizer.
    </p>
    <p>Of course it would be terribly reductive to represent something as complex
    as soil by a star or a single number, so we encourage you to click on each
    farm’s entry for more information. Clicking on the stars provides insight
    from a panel of soil scientists in regards to the context--soil type, weather
    patterns, soil history, slope, etc.
